#ACSports Custom Theme and Post Types


## Custom "Cards" Post Type

We created a custom post type (CPT) for trading cards. We use [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) to create custom attributes for this post type. [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) is used as the form provider to input card data. 

The following will create a new `card` post type:
1. User visits the [trading card page](http://acsportsj.kinsta.cloud/mls/)
2. User fills out the form
3. Form Submit creates a new `card` post from the form data. The [Advanced Post Creation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/advanced-post-creation-add-on/) add-on is used to
4. User is directed to the specifc post created by the form submit. Example [here](http://acsportsj.kinsta.cloud/cards/lebron-james/)

The custom post type (CPT) code is in the child theme [functions.php](https://github.com/tbrennan77/acsports/blob/main/wp-content/themes/buddyboss-theme-child/functions.php) file

`custom_post_type()` is the name of the function that creates the CPT.
